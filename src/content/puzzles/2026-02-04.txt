Three Treasures for Three Thieves

A selection of reputable newspaper pages from an eventful week...

> # THREE MASTERPIECES VANISH
> A triple heist at the Art Museum has resulted in three artifacts stolen in what appear to be unrelated incidents. 
> ***Portrait of a Patron***, the ***Viridian Vase***, and the ***Statue of Saraswati*** all disappeared from separate collections at the museum.
> The museum has declined to comment at the time of printing, but sources indicate that this is the handiwork of three master art thieves: ***Kenneth Klept***, ***Thomas Thirudan***, and ***Leo the Lifter***, the last of whom — sources tell us — was seen climbing out of the window of the Contemporary Collection.

> # MUSEUM COVER-UP EXPOSED?
> *An anonymous expert tells us what the museum is hiding*
> “... the idea that Donald Judd would ever make something as imprecise as a vase is ludicrous. It's a fake, I tell you. An outright forgery! As for the other artifact, there is a reason they don't let you bring your own cameras into the Renaissance Collection. Wouldn't want infrared light revealing an obvious replica..."

> # “I STOLE IT — TWICE!”
> * Thomas Thirudan writes in to right a wrong *
> “When I first stole it in ‘36, I never expected to have to steal it again. But when the museum replaced it with a replica to cover up my daring heist, I had to do it again so the world knew my name."

> # MUSEUM HUMILIATED
> “It is true that the painting we lost three days ago is not a genuine artifact," the head curator said at the first press conference since the heist that shook the art world.
> When pressed on the status of the investigation in the Modern Collection, he paused for several seconds before admitting, “Our investigation is starting to cast serious doubt on the legitimacy of that artifact as well."
