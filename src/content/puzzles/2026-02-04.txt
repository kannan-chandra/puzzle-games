Three Treasures for Three Thieves

Puzzle
---
A selection of headlines from an eventful week...

> # Three heists in one day!
> 3 objects, 3 thieves, 3 collections
> Thief A was spotted in Modern

> # An Embarrassment for the museum
> An expert comes out and says that the vase is a Donald Judd forgery and that the item in Rennaissance is a replica

> # A confession
> Thief B says he stole the Replica cos he didn't get credit for original heist.

> # Museum accepts
> Painting is not genuine. The artifact in the Modern Collection is not genuine.





=== CLUES (themed) ===
1. Vase is a Forgery.
2. Painting is not a Genuine.
3. Genuine is not displayed in Modern Collection.
4. Replica is displayed in Rennaissance Collection.

=== NOTES (verbatim) ===
Swap around the 3x3x3 for better theming. 
Add a fourth layer outside the logic puzzle for which thief took which item. One thief says he stole the replica because when he stole the original 20 years ago the museum hid it and didn't give him credit. 
Thief A -> Replica
Thief B -> Location
Thief C -> Artifact
An art expert has opinions about the fake and replica: the replica is kept in a specific gallery where he was not allowed in. Maybe his claim about the forgery is also about a room? it could also be about the item.
