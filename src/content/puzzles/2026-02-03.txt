A Wizard and his Staff

Puzzle

Arch Alchemist Geralt the Incomparable, Warden of the Seventh Distillation, looked upon the state of his domain.

His arcane laboratory lay in tatters. Shattered glass and shredded parchment was all that remained of years of work. And the culprit, his only member of staff, sat on his hind legs in the corner of the room.

Sir Snuggleheim the Cockapoo looked toward him, but not at him, his face a paradoxical mix of guilt and innocence.

Supreme Spellwright Gerald the Incalculable, Grand Curator of the Transmutative Tincture, looked down at his feet and recognized some words on a few fragments of paper. The detritus of his life's greatest work: **His Three Elixirs**. 

*Rapturous Repose.*
*Ethereal Elevation.*
*Spiritual Somnolence.*

Now, mere scraps. 

*"...for only a mighty fool looks to create Rapturous Repose using a Peel of Aurentium, which is rightfully only held in a Whiskey Glass..."*

*"... touch not Papaver Seed upon metal, lest you court insolvence..."*

*"The path to Spiritual Somnolence starts with a single Moonleaf..."*

With a deep sigh, he reached for a Whiskey Glass and placed within in a single Peel of Aurentium.

And so, not for the first time, and most definitely not the last, High Wizard Jerry the Inconsolable, Keeper of the Together, concocted a familiar brew.
