=== CLUES (themed) ===
1. Where was my first holiday? answer is Paris.
2. Oslo is before Brooklyn.
3. Paris is after What was my first pet called?.
4. Who was my first girlfriend? is after Paris.
5. Sydney is after Who was my first girlfriend?.

=== NOTES (verbatim) ===
This seems solvable in your head. I think this should be prose with corrupted code snippets. so each snippet can show relative order. also, add "Where was my first job?" as a standalone clue; that way, all 8 nouns are revealed in document form. Last question should be "What's the answer to the last question?"
