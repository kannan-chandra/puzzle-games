  "puzzle": "Tina Fey: Why do I always get the name that requires dramatic emphasis? I swear, if I mispronounce Leonardo DiCaprio on stage, Twitter will eat me alive.\n\nAmy Poehler: Relax. At least you don’t have to explain a joke while people are actively deciding whether they liked the movie. Mine is literally a joke making fun of the movie — and yes, it’s for Timothée Chalamet. Delicate situation.\n\nMaya Rudolph: Hey, that’s nothing. My card just says Michael B. Jordan. No joke, no commentary, just his name. Very serious vibes.\n\nAmy Poehler: Well, at least it’s not the dating joke. That one would be… complicated. And definitely not something you’d say right after mentioning Michael B. Jordan.\n\nTina Fey: Speaking of which, whoever has the dating joke better sell it fast and move on. This audience is sharp.\n\nMaya Rudolph: I’m just saying, my card feels important. Like, important important. The kind of important where you don’t want to mess it up.\n\nAmy Poehler: Cool, cool, cool. Love that energy right before we walk out in front of millions of people.\n\nTina Fey: Okay, jokes, names, vibes — whatever. We really need to figure out who the winner is, because we’re about to go on stage.",
